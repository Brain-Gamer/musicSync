# Music Sync
### What is this?
Music Sync is used to synchronize the content of a youtube playlist with your pc.
It will automatically download new tracks as mp3 and remove old ones.

### How to use
##### Adding a playlist
- Copy the playlist url (`www.youtube.com/playlist?list=xxx` or `www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy&list=xxx`)
- Open the playlist window and click the [+] button
- Select a folder to save the playlist


##### Removing a playlist
- Open the playlist window
- Click the [-] button of the playlist you want to remove

Important: this will remove the playlist from syncing but not the files!

##### Settings
- Set the time until new items are searched
- Set the maximum amount of simultaneous downloads

### Info
Music Sync is still WIP. You may find some bugs and if you do so please report them here.
This is my first electron and node.js based application.
If you are missing an important feature create an issue (or make your own plugin `not implemented yet`)
